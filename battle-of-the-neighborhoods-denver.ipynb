    "#### Since medical and recreational marijuana have been a reality in Denver, the city has saw a 45% increase in the housing market since 2010. With swarms of people still moving to Denver in present day, my goal here is to check whether the concentration of dispensaries is driving up the cost of living in certain neighborhoods. I have data from the city of Denver on active dispensaries, highest cost of living neighborhoods, and an official list of recognized neighborhoods from the city of Denver."
